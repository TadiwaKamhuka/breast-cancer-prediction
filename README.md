# Predicting Breast Cancer Using Classification Models

This project aims to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using classification models in Python.

#### Tools & Libraries

- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Python 
- Scikit-learn

#### Usage
To use this project, you can clone the repository and run the bcp.ipynb file. This file contains the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and training and evaluating the classification models.

You can modify the code in this file to use different classification models or to perform hyperparameter tuning for the models.
